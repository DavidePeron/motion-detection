\section{Processing Pipeline}
\label{sec:processing_architecture}

\MR{I would start the technical description with a {\it high level} introduction of your processing pipeline. Here you do not have to necessarily go into the technical details of every processing block, this will be done later as the paper develops. What I would like to see here is a description of the general approach, i.e., which processing blocks you used, how these were concatenated, etc. A diagram usually helps.}
